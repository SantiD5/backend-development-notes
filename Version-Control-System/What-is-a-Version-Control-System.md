# What is a version control system?
A **version control system (VCS)** is a software tool that helps developers manage and track changes to source code or other collections of files over time. It records every modification made to files in a database, enabling developers to revisit earlier versions of the code, identify and correct mistakes, and experiment without fear of losing progress.
### Benefits of a Version Control System:
1. **Error Recovery**: Allows developers to revert to previous versions if mistakes are made.
2. **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work.
3. **History Tracking**: Maintains a detailed history of changes, including who made each change and why.
4. **Branching and Merging**: Supports creating branches to work on features or fixes in isolation and later merging them back into the main codebase.
5. **Conflict Resolution**: Helps identify and resolve conflicts when multiple developers modify the same parts of the code.
### Types of Version Control Systems:
1. **Centralized VCS (CVCS)**: All versions are stored in a central server. Examples:
    - Subversion (SVN)
    - Perforce
2. **Distributed VCS (DVCS)**: Every developer has a full copy of the repository, including its history. Examples:
    - Git
    - Mercurial
### Why Teams Use Version Control Systems:
- They improve **collaboration** by allowing multiple contributors to work on the same project without conflicts.
- They make the development process **faster** and more **efficient** by enabling developers to experiment safely and track their progress.
- They provide a safety net for projects, minimizing disruption when issues arise.
