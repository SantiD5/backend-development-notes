# What is a web browser?
A web browser is an application used to access websites on the internet. It is software that allows users to access and view content on the World Wide Web. It acts like a translator, taking information from web servers and displaying it to the user as a web page.
### Rendering Engine - The Web Architecture
It is the main component of a web browser that converts the website code into visual elements visible on a web page. The rendering engine receives instructions from a browser, interprets them, and builds a webpage accordingly. Following are the rendering engines used by mainstream browsers:
- **Blink:** This engine powers Google Chrome and is known for its speed and efficiency.
- **WebKit:** Used in Safari (Apple devices) and other browsers, WebKit offers robust features for rendering complex webpages.
- **Gecko:** The engine behind Mozilla Firefox prioritizes open-source development and standards compliance.
### Browser Components
While the rendering engine plays a central role in the working of a web browser, multiple other components bring to you any web page you access via the internet. Some key components include:
- **User Interface (UI):** You interact with it directly. It includes the address bar, where you enter website addresses, the back and forward buttons for navigation, and the tabs that allow you to open multiple websites simultaneously.
- **Rendering Engine:** As discussed, the architect is responsible for building the visual representation of the webpage.
- **Networking Component:** It fetches website files (code, images, videos) from web servers worldwide, ensuring all the necessary pieces are delivered to the rendering engine to build the web page.
- **JavaScript Engine:** It interprets and executes JavaScript code, allowing webpages to respond to user actions and create dynamic experiences.
- **Security Components:** They handle tasks like encrypting data transmissions (HTTPS) and protecting you from malicious websites.

Each component plays a unique role and combines a completely functioning web browser.
