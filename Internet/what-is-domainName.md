# What is a domain Name?

A domain name is a string of text that maps to an alphanumeric IP Address, used to access a website. For instance, the domain name for Google is ‘google.com’. The actual addreess of a website is a complex numerical IP adress but thanks to DNS users are able to enter human-friendly domain names and be routed to the websites they are looking for. The process is known as DNS lookup. A domain name consists of two main parts: the **second-level domain** (e.g., “example” in “example.com”) and the **top-level domain** (e.g., “.com”).
## Who manages Domain names?
- Domain names are managed by **domain registrars** and **domain registries**:
- **Domain Registrars**: These are companies that allow individuals or organizations to register domain names. Examples include GoDaddy, Namecheap, and Google Domains. Registrars handle the actual registration process, manage domain renewals, and provide services like DNS management, email forwarding, and privacy protection.
- **Domain Registries**: These are organizations that manage the database of domain names for specific top-level domains (TLDs), like .com, .org, or .net. The registry is responsible for maintaining the records of domain names under its TLD. For example, Verisign is the registry for .com and .net TLDs.
## What is the difference between a domain name and a URL?
A uniform resource locator (URL), sometimes called a web address, contains the domain name of a site as well as other information, including the protocol and the path. For example, in the URL ‘https://DelgadoBlog.com/blog/’, ‘DelgadoBlog.com’ is the domain name, while https is the protocol and ‘/blog/’ is the path to a specific page on the website.
