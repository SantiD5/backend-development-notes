# How does the internet works?
The internet works by connecting devices and computer systems together using a set of standardized procotols. These Protocols define the way the information is exchanged between devices and ensure the data is transmitted and secure.
## The role of protocols in Internet
Protocols play a critical role in enabling communication and data exchange over the internet. A protocol is a set of rules and standards that define how the information is exchanged between devices and systems.
### Basic Protocols
- **Internet Protocol(IP)**: The Internet Protocol assigns a unique address (IP address) to each device connected to a network, enabling them to communicate. IP is responsible for routing data packets across networks, ensuring they reach their correct destination.
- **Transmission control procotol(TCP)**: Ensure that packets are transmitted reliably and in correct order.
- **Domain Name System(DNS)**: Translates human-readable domain names (like `example.com`) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network.
- **Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP)**:A protocol used for transferring web pages on the internet. HTTP is stateless, meaning each request from a client to a server is independent and does not rely on previous requests.
- **Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)**: An encrypted version of HTTP, using SSL/TLS to secure the communication between web browsers and servers. HTTPS ensures privacy, integrity, and authentication in web transactions.
When you send data over the internet is broken up into small **packets** that are sent from your device to a router. The router examines the packet and forwards it to the next router in the path towards its destination. This process continues until the packet reaches its final destination. 
## Securing Internet Communication with SSL/TLS
SSL/TLS is a protocol used to encrypt data being transmitted over the internet. It is commonly used to provide secure connections for applications such as web browsers, email clients, and file transfer programs.
When using SSL/TLS to secure internet communication, there are a few key concepts to understand:
- **Certificates:** SSL/TLS certificates are used to establish trust between the client and server. They contain information about the identity of the server and are signed by a trusted third party (a Certificate Authority) to verify their authenticity.
- **Handshake:** During the SSL/TLS handshake process, the client and server exchange information to negotiate the encryption algorithm and other parameters for the secure connection.
- **Encryption:** Once the secure connection is established, data is encrypted using the agreed-upon algorithm and can be transmitted securely between the client and server.
When building internet-based applications and services, it’s important to understand how SSL/TLS works and to ensure that your application is designed to use SSL/TLS when transmitting sensitive data such as login credentials, payment information, and other personal data. You’ll also need to ensure that you obtain and maintain valid SSL/TLS certificates for your servers, and that you follow best practices for configuring and securing your SSL/TLS connections. By doing so, you can help protect your users’ data and ensure the integrity and confidentiality of your application’s communication over the internet.
